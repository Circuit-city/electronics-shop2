## Database
The website uses PostgreSQL as the database to store all the necessary data, including user information, product information, and order information.

## Frontend
The frontend of the website is built using ReactJs and Redux Toolkit. It communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data to the user.

## Testing
Jest and Minitests are used for testing the website. Unit tests are written to ensure the functionality of the website, and integration tests are written to ensure that the frontend and backend work together seamlessly.

## Wireframes
The website's wireframes were created using Figma, ensuring that the website is mobile-friendly and has an excellent user interface.
